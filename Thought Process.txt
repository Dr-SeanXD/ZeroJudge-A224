Because the question requires it to be "rearranged," we need to use the definition of a palindrome to determine if the string can be rearranged into one. 
In a palindrome, each character appears in pairs, unless the length of the string is odd, in which case the middle character appears unpaired. 
Therefore, we can use a map to count the occurrence of each character and use "isalpha(str[i])" and "tolower(str[i])" to determine if the current character is an English letter and force all letters to lowercase to avoid capital case issues. 
After the loop, iterate from 0 to 26 once to ensure that the map value of each letter is even. 
If there is more than one letter with an odd count (the case where the middle character appears unpaired), the string cannot be rearranged into a palindrome.
